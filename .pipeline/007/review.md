## Summary
Reviewed the reconciliation engine against the spec. Architecture is clean, modular and testable.

## Strengths
- Pure-function core is trivially testable.
- Integer minor-units avoid floating point drift.
- Clear separation between model and engine.

## Risks
- No source-adapter abstraction implemented yet.
- Date matching is exact-string; timezone handling is unaddressed.

## Maintainability
High — small surface area, strong typing, no global state.
